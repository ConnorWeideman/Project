## Introduction
We have developed an application to assist small businesses in their day to day operations. We have partnered with our sponsor **Insert Sponsor Here** to upgrade their current systems from excel spreadsheets and paper financial records to a digital system capable of handling finances and stock management.

## Problem Statement
Manual stock taking and financial records is very slow and prone to human error.

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must be able to manage a database of stock.
1. The system must be able to record transactions and update stock levels appropraitely.
1. The system must be able to notify the user if stock levels get low.
1. The system must be able to generate financial reports based on the transactions throughout the month.

## Non-functional Requirements
1. The system must use as little memory as required.
1. The system must be able to generate reports in a timely manner.
1. The purchasing system must have a friendly user-interface.

## Feasibility and Risk Study
The system is similar to existing projects that already exist today, however, due to the customizable nature of this project our sponsor will have a tailor made solution that will fit their business needs specifically. Our solution is technically simple, meaning that our users will be able to run our system on a basic computer running windows. Due to this there is no extra costs included with setup and running of our system, pair this with our custom pricing for our sponsor and our system is an extremely affordable and attractive choice. We will provide operational training to our sponsor as well as provide documentation and instrunctions on how to use it. We will also design our program in a very user friendly manner meaning operation should not be an issue.
